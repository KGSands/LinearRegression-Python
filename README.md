# Simple Linear Regression in Python

- Data generated from a noisy sin function.
- 50 data points (25 training, 25 testing).
- Simplified cubic feature
- Least-square error

Note: The file data.txt contains the data produced from running the code from the last instance of running. The code will produce a graph which plots the resulting function with the data points in the training set.
